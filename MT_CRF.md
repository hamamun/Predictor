# MT_CRF.md — Build specification

> **Status: SPEC ONLY. No MQL5 code written yet.**
> **Revision: 2026-11-09 — added `InpCrfCloseProfitableM15` (default `true`).**
>
> This file is meant to be copied into **`hamamun/MT`** before the build request.
> It currently lives in `hamamun/Predictor` on branch `arena/4260aa7c-predictor` only so you can review and move it.
> The real build must run in a checkout/session tied to `hamamun/MT`, not this Predictor branch.
>
> Target MT head checked: `4e5c545` (`Merge pull request #28 from hamamun/arena/0140cc77-mt`).
> All 14 existing MT Python/C++-stub tests passed on that head. Native MetaEditor compile, Strategy Tester and demo-broker behaviour are **still unverified** in MT's own README.

## 1. Source functionality to port: `confirmed_reversal_forecast`

This is the **first** thing the build must reproduce. Port this file **exactly as it behaves**, not the original `reversal_forecast.indie` and not the newer `reversal_continuation_forecast.indie`.

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Source file | `confirmed_reversal_forecast.indie` |
| Repo / commit | `hamamun/Predictor`, `main` @ `9056bd0` |
| Size | 1568 lines, 88007 bytes |
| SHA256 | `c9bee5bf0154a9eb49e9957a9c6879072ef5b187feabaadb7494c9bf19b4a1ee` |
| Indicator title | `Confirmed Reversal Forecast (Historical Analogs)` |
| Timeframe | **Fixed `PERIOD_M15` closed bars**; reuses MT's existing M15 lane. The EA may be attached to **M5, M15 or M30** — CRF still reads M15 bars. Attaching to M15 is recommended for clarity only, **not required**. No other HTF |
| Plots | 6 (`@plot.` decorators / 6 returned plots) |

### 1.1 Candle patterns — 3 families / 10 named forms

Port only these:

1. **Engulfing**
   - `Bullish engulfing`
   - `Bearish engulfing`
2. **Hammer family** (direction decided by prior trend + swing location)
   - `Hammer`
   - `Inverted hammer`
   - `Hanging man`
   - `Shooting star`
   - `Hammer family` (generic label when the variant is not resolved)
3. **Stars**
   - `Morning star`
   - `Evening star`
   - `Morning doji star`
   - `Evening doji star`

Rules:

- **A Doji alone never gives direction.**
- Do **not** add Piercing Line / Dark Cloud Cover, Tweezer, Kicker, Abandoned Baby, Marubozu, Three White Soldiers / Black Crows, Inside / Outside, Spinning Top, standalone Dragonfly / Gravestone Doji, or any other family.
- Do **not** loosen the filters or remove closed-candle confirmation.

### 1.2 Context filters and inputs

Fixed internal values in the Indie source:

| Fixed rule | Value |
|---|---|
| `minimum_trend_atr` | `1.0` |
| `swing_tolerance_atr` | `1.0` |
| `confirmation_bars` | `2` |
| Cooldown | `swing_length + confirmation_bars`, per direction, set **only when a candidate starts** |
| `context_length` | `max(atr_length, trend_length, swing_length) + 3` |
| `can_calculate` | `bar_count > context_length + 2` |

User-facing CRF inputs (use the same defaults and ranges; prefix MQL5 names with `InpCrf` to avoid collisions with existing MT inputs):

| Indie param | Default | Min | Max | MQL5 input |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `history_bars` | 600 | 100 | 2000 | `InpCrfHistoryBars` |
| `max_horizon` | 24 | 4 | 100 | `InpCrfMaxHorizon` |
| `atr_length` | 14 | 2 | 100 | `InpCrfAtrLength` |
| `trend_length` | 12 | 2 | 100 | `InpCrfTrendLength` |
| `volume_length` | 20 | 2 | 200 | `InpCrfVolumeLength` |
| `swing_length` | 20 | 3 | 200 | `InpCrfSwingLength` |
| `minimum_analogs` | 6 | 2 | 50 | `InpCrfMinimumAnalogs` |
| `minimum_followthrough_pct` | 55 | 1 | 99 | `InpCrfMinFollowthroughPct` |
| `minimum_reward_risk` | 1.2 | 0.5 | 5.0 (step 0.1) | `InpCrfMinRewardRisk` |

**MT-only CRF input (not from Indie; the only extra input besides `InpMode`):**

```mql5
input bool InpCrfCloseProfitableM15 = true; // Allow CRF to close profitable M15 MT position
```

Default is **true**. No second input for a manual minimum profit; the cost buffer is computed internally (Section 2.4). Both this input and `InpMode` live in `MT_CRF_Inputs.mqh`.

Context logic to keep:

- Prior move must be at least `1.0 ATR` over `trend_length`.
- Bullish setup must sit near a `swing_length` swing low; bearish near a swing high, within `1.0 ATR`.
- Volume ratio uses `volume_length` preceding bars as baseline.
- One raw candidate per swing via the direction-specific cooldown; nearby raw patterns are merged/ignored; an opposite-direction candidate remains possible.

### 1.3 Raw candidate → confirmed signal

This is the false-reversal fix. Keep it exactly.

1. A raw candle makes a **candidate**, not a signal.
2. Candidate stores: direction, break level, stop level, pattern, variant, ATR, volume ratio, trend, swing-location feature, marker level, elapsed = 0.
3. Confirmation is a **close-break** on a later **closed** candle:
   - BUY: `close[1] > pending_break`
   - SELL: `close[1] < pending_break`
4. Up to `confirmation_bars = 2` closed bars are allowed.
5. If not confirmed in time → `Candidate expired; no confirmation`.
6. While a candidate is pending, new nearby raw patterns are ignored (`Nearby pattern ignored`).
7. Confirmation entry = `self.close[1]` (the closed candle's close).
8. A genuinely new confirmed reversal while a forecast is active **replaces** it; an opposite one is `Opposite confirmed reversal`.

### 1.4 Historical analog estimate

Use the **same confirmed-reversal definition** for historical selection. Do **not** reuse MT's `P3ObservedTargetR()` percentile favorable-excursion replay for CRF.

Keep:

- Scan range: `history_start = max_horizon + confirmation_bars + 3`, `history_end = history_bars`.
- Same pattern families, same context filters, same two-bar confirmation rule.
- Similarity features: ATR, volume ratio, prior trend, swing location.
- Similarity threshold `>= 2.0`; analogs spaced at least `max_horizon` bars apart.
- Historical target: `hist_entry + direction * hist_risk * minimum_reward_risk`.
- Each historical episode ends at that target, an opposite confirmed reversal, or the `max_horizon` cap.
- Weighted outputs: expected move in ATR, expected duration, follow-through confidence %, analog count, estimate quality.
- Duration range: weighted mean ± `MathSqrt(variance) * 0.75`, clamped `>= 1`, `duration_high > duration_low`, capped by `max_horizon`.
- **`duration_high` is the hard expiry** → `Forecast expires in`. The typical `Expected duration` number is **not** a deadline. No extension.

Estimate gates:

| Gate | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `estimate_available` | `analog_count >= 2` and valid weighted move / duration / entry / stop |
| `forecast_ready` | `analog_count >= minimum_analogs` AND `confidence >= minimum_followthrough_pct` AND `expected_move_atr >= risk_in_atr * minimum_reward_risk` |
| `Estimate quality` | `Meets selected filters`, `Low sample count`, `Below follow-through filter`, `Below reward/risk filter`, or `No historical estimate` |

**Auto-trading-only gate (new, not a change to the display):** the bot places a CRF order **only when `Estimate quality = Meets selected filters`**. A weak estimate is still shown on the panel but is not traded.

### 1.5 Active forecast and close events

Monitor only on a **new closed candle**. Stop wins a same-bar stop/target tie.

| Result code | `Last result / update` text | Meaning |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | `TP estimate reached` | Closed-bar high/low reached TP estimate |
| 2 | `Stop loss touched` | Closed-bar high/low reached stop |
| 3 | `Opposite confirmed reversal` | Fresh opposite confirmed reversal replaces forecast |
| 4 | `Duration limit reached; no extension` | Hard expiry (`remaining <= 0`) |
| 5 | `Replaced by newer signal` | Fresh same-direction confirmed reversal |
| 6 | `No historical estimate` | Confirmation happened but no usable estimate |

| Event code | `Last result / update` fallback text |
|---:|---|
| 1 | `Candidate appeared` |
| 2 | `Forecast confirmed` |
| 3 | `Candidate expired; no confirmation` |
| 4 | `Forecast closed` |
| 5 | `Confirmed reversal; no estimate` |
| 6 | `Nearby pattern ignored` |

Rules:

- One active forecast, one entry, one SL, one TP.
- Old TP is **erased**, never extended or updated.
- Never two TPs. No staged TP, rolling target, indefinite extension, rewriting a closed result, or turning a closed/missed forecast into a win.
- `Data through` = `Last closed candle | chart bar count N`.
- `Last result / update` follows the newest event/result and shows `| this bar` or `| N bars ago`.

### 1.6 Dashboard — 15 rows

Header + 14 rows, left-aligned below the indicator header. In MT: the key fields are mirrored into the **M15 readings/plan/auto rows**; the full 15-row table lives in the separate details window (`CRF only`) or is reachable from it (`MT + CRF`).

| # | Row | Idle label in confirmed variant |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | `CONFIRMED REVERSAL FORECAST` + `BUY` / `SELL` / `BUY?` / `SELL?` / `BUY (last)` / `SELL (last)` / `--` | header |
| 2 | `Status` | `Waiting for new confirmed reversal` |
| 3 | `Pattern` | `Last pattern` |
| 4 | `Pending candidate` | `Pending candidate` |
| 5 | `Data through` | `Data through` |
| 6 | `Entry / trigger` | `Last entry` |
| 7 | `Stop loss` | `Last SL` |
| 8 | `TP estimate` | `Last TP` |
| 9 | `Expected move` | `Last expected move` |
| 10 | `Expected duration` | `Last duration` |
| 11 | `Estimate quality` | `Last estimate quality` |
| 12 | `Historical follow-through / samples` | same |
| 13 | `Forecast expires in` | same |
| 14 | `No-signal reason` | same |
| 15 | `Last result / update` | same |

**Important:** `confirmed_reversal_forecast.indie` **retains** `Last entry` / `Last SL` / `Last TP` / `Last duration` / etc. when idle (`historical_view = True`). Keep that behaviour. The PR #8 third file's "blank all level rows when idle" behaviour is **not** ported here.

### 1.7 Plots → MT chart objects

Port the 6 Indie outputs as MT5 chart objects with prefix `MTCRF_`, cleaned up on `OnDeinit` / Mode change:

| Indie plot | MT object |
|---|---|
| Yellow `Reversal candidate (unconfirmed)` marker below bar | small yellow dot / arrow, `offset=-1` |
| Green `Confirmed bullish reversal` marker below | green dot |
| Red `Confirmed bearish reversal` marker above | red dot |
| Aqua `Forecast entry` steps | horizontal aqua line |
| Red `Forecast stop loss` steps | horizontal red line |
| Yellow `Forecast TP estimate` steps | horizontal yellow line |

Step lines must break (not connect) between unrelated forecasts, using an invalid/NaN equivalent.

### 1.8 Hardening to carry over

- `MathIsValidNumber()` everywhere instead of Python `isnan()`.
- Guarded state-to-int conversions (`0` fallback for invalid/NaN state).
- Finite `price_digits` fallback `5` when `SYMBOL_DIGITS` is unusable.
- Guarded target/move formatting; no `nan` text on the panel.
- Dynamic freshness: `Data through`, `No-signal reason`, `Last result / update` bars ago.
- Sanitize corrupted persisted state on load.

### 1.9 Source-fidelity checklist (audit)

This section exists to prove Section 1 still describes **`confirmed_reversal_forecast.indie` exactly**, not a simplified or mixed version. Source checked: `c9bee5bf0154a9eb49e9957a9c6879072ef5b187feabaadb7494c9bf19b4a1ee`, 1568 lines / 88007 bytes.

| Source construct | Spec section | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 3 families / 10 named forms, Doji alone no direction | 1.1 | ✅ exact list, exclusions kept |
| 9 `@param` inputs + defaults/ranges | 1.2 | ✅ exact |
| `minimum_trend_atr=1.0`, `swing_tolerance_atr=1.0`, `confirmation_bars=2`, cooldown `swing_length+2` | 1.2 | ✅ exact |
| prior-trend + swing-location context, volume baseline | 1.2 | ✅ exact |
| raw candidate → close-break within 2 closed bars → expiry / merge / cooldown | 1.3 | ✅ exact |
| same-rule historical analogs, similarity `>=2.0`, spacing `>= max_horizon`, weighted move/duration/follow-through/samples | 1.4 | ✅ exact |
| duration range = weighted mean ± root(variance)*0.75, clamp `>=1`, cap `max_horizon`, **upper range = hard expiry** | 1.4 / 6 | ✅ same formula; MQL5 `MathSqrt` replaces Indie manual Newton root |
| `estimate_available` / `forecast_ready` / 5 quality labels | 1.4 | ✅ exact |
| 6 result codes + 6 event codes, stop wins same-bar tie, no extension | 1.5 | ✅ exact |
| 15-row dashboard, retained `Last ...` idle labels | 1.6 | ✅ exact |
| 6 plots → `MTCRF_*` objects | 1.7 | ✅ exact drawing set |
| NaN / guarded-int / finite `price_digits` / freshness hardening | 1.8 | ✅ exact |

**What is intentionally different:** Sections 2–7 are MT5 adaptations (MQL5 state instead of `MutSeriesF`, `CopyRates` instead of `self.close[1]`, broker orders instead of display-only, `30007` diary). They do **not** change the forecast logic above. `InpCrfCloseProfitableM15` (Section 2.4) is an **auto-trading-only** rule about an existing MT position; it does not change candle detection, confirmation, analogs, TP/SL/duration or close events.

---

## 2. Mode input (new decision)

This supersedes the earlier "no input / fully automatic" discussion. Add **one** new input:

```mql5
enum ENUM_MT_CRF_MODE
{
   MT_CRF_MODE_BOTH = 0,   // MT + CRF (default)
   MT_CRF_MODE_MT   = 1,   // MT only
   MT_CRF_MODE_CRF  = 2    // CRF only
};
input ENUM_MT_CRF_MODE InpMode = MT_CRF_MODE_BOTH; // Mode
```

Put it in a new `MT_CRF_Inputs.mqh`, together with `InpCrfCloseProfitableM15` (Section 2.4, default `true`). Do **not** rename or reorder existing MT inputs.

MT's existing `InpAutoTrading` (default `false`) remains the **real-money master switch**. CRF never sends an order when it is `false`, in any Mode. CRF can still scan and display.

### 2.1 Mode behaviour

| Mode | CRF background scan | MT lanes | New MT orders | CRF orders | Panel |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MT only` | **Off** | Full, unchanged | Yes, existing rules | **No** | Exactly today's MT panel; no CRF text/objects |
| `MT + CRF` **(default)** | Always, on **M15** closed bars | M5/M30 normal; M15 switches to CRF during takeover | **Only M15 MT entries paused** during CRF takeover; M5/M30 continue; M15 resumes after CRF end + next M15 bar + reconciliation | Yes, in the **existing M15 auto row**, when `InpAutoTrading=true` and quality gate passes | Current MT panel + **2 small header lines**; M15 readings/plan/auto rows show CRF while active |
| `CRF only` | Always, on **M15** closed bars | M5/M30 hidden; M15 row is CRF only | **No MT orders at all** | Yes, in the **existing M15 auto row**, when `InpAutoTrading=true` and quality gate passes | MT header/settings kept; only the M15-shaped readings/plan/auto rows remain, all CRF; full 15-row dashboard in the separate details window |

**New input:** `InpCrfCloseProfitableM15` (default `true`) — see Section 2.4.

### 2.2 Meaning of "MT + CRF"

This is a **temporary M15-lane takeover**, not a 4th trading line and not two robots on M15:

1. MT keeps calculating and showing M5/M15/M30 readings and plans.
2. CRF scans quietly behind on **M15 closed bars** in all modes except `MT only`.
3. On a confirmed CRF forecast with `Meets selected filters`, CRF takes **the existing M15 lane**:
   - request cancellation of the **M15 MT pending limit** only (broker-confirmed, can race a fill);
   - **block new MT M15 entries** until the M15 slot is free; M5/M30 keep their normal rules;
   - if an MT M15 position is already open, apply **Section 2.4**: with `InpCrfCloseProfitableM15=true` and net profit above the internal cost buffer, close it after broker checks; otherwise show `Waiting for closing` and wait;
   - never open a second M15 position; wait for broker-confirmed close + next M15 bar before the CRF order.
4. Only **one CRF position** is opened, displayed in the **M15 auto row** (internally still `MT4-CRF` / `30007`).
5. After CRF ends and the broker confirms no CRF position remains, the M15 lane waits for its next closed bar + reconciliation, then returns to normal MT.
6. CRF immediately goes back to watching behind until the next call.

This keeps MT's existing one-position-per-timeframe design: M5, M30 and (CRF-on-)M15, never four slots.

### 2.3 Mode switch / restart

- Changing `InpMode` reinitializes the EA (MT already does this for input changes).
- Changing `InpMode` itself never closes existing MT open positions. A CRF takeover may close an MT M15 position only under Section 2.4.
- Existing MT pending limits follow MT's existing cancellation rules. During a CRF takeover only the **M15** pending limit is requested for cancellation; M5/M30 pending limits are left alone.
- CRF candidate / forecast / order-link state is persisted in the same per-account/server/symbol journal style as `P4Save()` / `P4Load()`, with a tester sandbox.
- On restart, reconcile with the broker before resuming; do not blindly trust in-memory state.
- `MT only` must not call any CRF scan, draw any `MTCRF_` object, or write any CRF journal row.

### 2.4 New input: allow CRF to close a profitable M15 MT position

This is the **only** extra CRF input besides `InpMode`:

```mql5
input bool InpCrfCloseProfitableM15 = true; // Allow CRF to close profitable M15 MT position
```

Default **true**. You pasted an example line ending in `false`, but your instruction says **default true**; this spec uses **true**. No second input for a manual minimum profit.

When `InpMode = MT + CRF`, a confirmed CRF forecast with `Meets selected filters` finds an **already-open MT-native M15 position** (magic `P4Magic(1)`, comment `MT4-M15`, strategy `30004` / `30006`):

| `InpCrfCloseProfitableM15` | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `false` | Current safe rule: **never close** the MT position. Leave its broker SL/TP. CRF waits for the M15 slot to free naturally. |
| `true` **(default)** | Compute `net = POSITION_PROFIT + POSITION_SWAP + POSITION_COMMISSION` and an internal `closeCostBuffer`, then follow the rules below. |

`closeCostBuffer` is computed internally from the current spread (`q.ask - q.bid`), `SYMBOL_TRADE_TICK_VALUE` / `OrderCalcProfit` for the position volume, accrued commission and one tick of slippage. It is **not** a user input.

With `true`:

- **`net > closeCostBuffer`** → request a **market close** of that MT M15 position. Requires `InpAutoTrading=true`, market open, fresh quote, `OrderCheck`, filling mode and hedging account for the later CRF entry. Wait for `P4PositionClosed()` broker confirmation + next **M15** closed bar, then open the CRF order. Never two M15 positions.
- **`net <= closeCostBuffer`** (negative, zero, or too small after costs) → **do not close**. M15 auto row and 2nd-row `CRF:` line show `Waiting for closing`. Re-check on every new M15 closed bar while the CRF forecast is still alive. If it later becomes `net > closeCostBuffer`, close and open CRF. If CRF hard expiry arrives first, the forecast expires with `Duration limit reached; no extension`; no trade, no extension, no forced close.
- **Ambiguous close / partial close / multiple M15 objects / unavailable history** → `REVIEW`, no CRF order.
- The closed MT trade keeps its `30004` / `30006` diary result. The new CRF trade is `30007`. Do not rewrite the MT result.

M5/M30 positions and pending limits are **never** touched by this rule. `CRF only` has no MT positions, so the input has no effect there. `MT only` ignores it. `InpAutoTrading=false` blocks the close even when this input is `true`.

---

## 3. What stays unchanged in MT

Do not edit the behaviour of:

- `MT.mq5` Phase 1 header, clock, market state, session table, symbol classification.
- `P2Update()` / `P2Evaluate()` → GT, CT, ST, RG, PT, SC, SG for M5/M15/M30.
- `P3Signal()`, `P3SelectedTrend()`, `P3MarketStyle()`, `P3VolumeState()`.
- `P3GeometryAt()`, `P3ObservedTargetR()`, `P3MakePlanAt()`, `P3MakePlan()`, `P3PlanLine()`.
- `P3Lot()` / `P3Volume()` / 0.5% equity sizing / `Bypass Risk` / `Minimum Lot use`.
- `P4Decide()`, `P4Refresh()`, `P4Place()`, `P4Modify()`, `P4Cancel()`, pending 3-bar expiry, cooldown.
- `MT_Panel.mqh` existing objects, `MT_TradeDiaryRuntime.mqh` schema, strategy IDs `30004` / `30006`.
- `InpAutoTrading`, `InpPlaceStopLoss`, `InpUseAutoSchedule` (09:15–17:00 local), `InpAutoStartTime`, `InpAutoEndTime`, `InpAllowAutoM5/M15/M30`.
- `InpAllowAutoM15` still gates **normal MT M15** entries; during a CRF takeover the M15 slot is CRF-owned, while `InpAllowAutoM5/M30` keep working normally.
- **One approved exception:** with `InpCrfCloseProfitableM15=true`, CRF may close an MT-native M15 position (Section 2.4). `P4Decide()` for M5/M30 and all other open-position handling stay unchanged.
- All 14 existing test files must still pass.

Only **add** new files plus the smallest possible dispatcher/gate edits.

---

## 4. CRF auto-trading rules

CRF uses MT's safety layer; it does **not** build a second order engine.

### 4.1 Permission chain (all must pass)

1. `InpMode != MT_CRF_MODE_MT`
2. `InpAutoTrading == true`
3. `P4CanTrade()` / hedging account / terminal+EA trade permission
4. `P4ScheduleOpen()` (daily timer) and `P4ScheduleBarReady()`
5. `g_marketState == MARKET_OPEN`
6. `P4FreshQuote()` (broker-anchored, <= 10 s)
7. Spread / `SYMBOL_TRADE_STOPS_LEVEL` / tick-size checks
8. `OrderCheck()` before send
9. CRF `Estimate quality == Meets selected filters`
10. No existing CRF position, no ambiguous broker state, and the **M15 slot is available** — either free, or an MT M15 position that Section 2.4 allows CRF to close (broker-confirmed first)

### 4.2 Order identity

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Comment | `MT4-CRF` (starts with `MT4-`, so `P4Refresh()` ownership check still recognises it) |
| Magic | New dedicated CRF magic, separate from `P4Magic(0..2)` |
| Diary strategy ID | **`30007`** (new; do not change `30004` / `30006`) |
| Broker SL | **Always ON** for CRF orders, even if `InpPlaceStopLoss=false` (that input applies only to MT-native lanes) |
| Broker TP | **Always ON**, exactly one, from CRF |
| Order type | Market at current quote (see 4.3) |
| One position | Strictly one CRF position at a time, displayed in the **existing M15 auto row** (no 4th row) |
| Display slot | Existing **M15** `MARKET READINGS` / `TRADING PLANS` / `AUTO EXECUTION` rows |
| M15 slot rule | Section 2.4: close profitable MT M15 position when `InpCrfCloseProfitableM15=true`; otherwise wait |

### 4.3 Entry price and slippage

- CRF `plan.entry` = **last closed candle close** (`rates[n-1].close`), used for SL/TP geometry.
- Actual market request price = current **Ask for BUY / Bid for SELL**, not the closed close.
- Keep CRF SL/TP as **absolute prices**; do not recompute them from the fill.
- Lot sizing uses `OrderCalcProfit()` with the **actual request price** and CRF stop.
- Record `entry_slippage_vs_original_plan_price` (MT diary already has this column).
- Do **not** place a limit at the closed close; confirmation is a close-break and a limit may never fill.

### 4.4 No fake score

`P4PlanMatchesSignal()` requires `score == ±2 / ±3`. CRF has no MT score. **Do not fabricate one.** Add a separate `CRFPlace()` path that reuses:

`OrderCheck`, `P4FreshQuote`, `P4SpreadOK`, `P4RequestLot`, `P4ProtectionAllowed`, `P4FillMode`, `P5Begin`, journal intent, `P4Persist()`, broker reconciliation and `P4View` status — but validates a `CRFPlan` instead of `P3Plan`.

### 4.5 Exits — broker-confirmed, not candle-touch

The Indie dashboard uses closed-bar high/low for `TP estimate reached` / `Stop loss touched`. In the bot, **takeover ends only from broker-confirmed state**:

| CRF event | Bot action |
|---|---|
| Broker TP fills | CRF ends, record `30007` result, M15 row returns to normal MT |
| Broker SL fills | CRF ends, record `30007` result, M15 row returns to normal MT |
| Hard expiry (`Forecast expires in` reaches 0) and position still open | **Request market close**, wait for broker confirmation, then end. No extension. |
| Opposite confirmed reversal | Close old CRF position, cancel any CRF pending, start **fresh CRF forecast** (do not return to MT) |
| Newer same-direction confirmed reversal | Close old CRF position, start **fresh CRF forecast** (do not return to MT) |
| `No historical estimate` / weak quality | No order; CRF keeps watching |
| MT M15 slot not freed before CRF hard expiry | Forecast expires with `Duration limit reached; no extension`; no CRF order, no forced close, M15 row returns to normal MT |

A dashboard price-touch **alone** never ends takeover while a broker position is still open. After any CRF end, wait for broker reconciliation + next **M15** closed bar before the M15 lane resumes normal MT entries; M5/M30 were never paused.

### 4.6 Bar type guard

MT already has `P3HasBidBars()`. If `SYMBOL_CHART_MODE != SYMBOL_CHART_MODE_BID`, CRF historical replay must be labelled `Bars: Last/unknown proxy` (same idea as MT's `barProxy`) or disabled. Do **not** silently treat Last OHLC as historical Bid quotes.

---

## 5. Panel design

Keep MT's top header always (symbol, market state, clock, trade totals, timer, Bid/Ask). Losing broker status during a live auto trade is unsafe.

**No separate CRF strip and no 4th auto row.** CRF reuses the existing **M15** lane rows.

### 5.1 Two small header additions

| Where | What | Modes |
|---|---|---|
| **2nd row, beside the timer detail** (the row directly under the header) | One line: `CRF: <state>`. If timer detail is hidden, the CRF line still appears on that row. | `MT + CRF`, `CRF only` |
| **Settings box, first row, immediately after `Minimum Lot`** | `Input mode: MT + CRF` / `Input mode: MT only` / `Input mode: CRF only`. Display of `InpMode`, not a new click control. | **all three** |

`CRF:` one-line states:

| State | Text |
|---|---|
| Watching | `CRF: watching M15 closed candles / no candidate` |
| Candidate | `CRF: BUY candidate / waiting confirmation (2 bars left)` — **not** "reversal detected" |
| Active | `CRF: BUY confirmed / expires in 19 bars / Auto ON / order #123` |
| Closed | `CRF: TP hit / SL hit / expired → M15 back to MT` |
| New reversal | `CRF: new SELL confirmed / fresh forecast` (not `→ MT`) |
| Waiting for slot | `CRF: BUY confirmed / waiting for M15 slot (MT position negative or below cost buffer)` |

### 5.2 `MT + CRF` — M15 row takeover

| Panel part | Idle / normal | While CRF candidate or active | After CRF ends |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MARKET READINGS` M5 / M30 | normal MT | normal MT | normal MT |
| `MARKET READINGS` **M15** | normal MT `GT/CT/ST/RG/PT/SC/SG` | `GT/CT/ST/RG/SC = --`, `PT = CRF ~Nb`, `SG = BUY (CRF)` / `SELL (CRF)` / `BUY? (CRF)` | back to normal MT |
| `TRADING PLANS` **M15** | normal MT plan | `M15 / Signal: BUY (CRF) / Pattern / MARKET / Entry / Lot / SL / TP / Expected move / Expected duration / Quality / Samples / Expires in N bars / Auto ON/OFF` | back to normal MT plan |
| `AUTO EXECUTION` **M15** | normal MT M15 row | `M15 / Auto: ON/OFF / CRF OPEN / BUY / broker entry / lot / SL / TP / P/L / TP distance / expires in N / order # / 30007` | back to normal MT M15 row |
| `AUTO EXECUTION` M5 / M30 | normal MT | normal MT (not paused) | normal MT |

Do **not** fake CRF values into GT/CT/ST/RG/SC. `SG` must match the M15 plan card, which is exactly MT's existing rule. `PT` carries the CRF `Forecast expires in` count.

When `InpCrfCloseProfitableM15=true` and the MT M15 position is not profitable enough to close, the M15 auto row shows `Waiting for closing | net ... | CRF BUY confirmed (Nb left)` instead of `CRF OPEN`. With the input `false`, it shows `Waiting for M15 slot` and **never** requests a close.

### 5.3 `CRF only`

- Header + settings stay; `Input mode: CRF only`.
- M5 and M30 readings / plans / auto rows are hidden.
- The **M15-shaped** readings / plan / auto rows are permanently CRF (same fields as 5.2).
- The full **15-row `CONFIRMED REVERSAL FORECAST`** dashboard opens in the existing separate details window (same mechanism as `Show diary details`), so the main panel stays compact and M15-shaped.
- No MT orders in any lane; `InpCrfCloseProfitableM15` has no effect (there is no MT M15 position to close).

### 5.4 `MT only`

100% current MT panel. No `CRF:` line, no CRF rows, no `MTCRF_` objects; `Input mode: MT only` is still shown on the settings first row. `InpCrfCloseProfitableM15` is ignored.

CRF trades still use their own `30007` ledger and `MT4-CRF` comment internally, even though they are displayed in the M15 row. Header `T/A` chips keep their current MT meaning.

## 6. Indie → MQL5 mapping

| Indie | MQL5 |
|---|---|
| `self.close[1]`, `self.high[1]`, `self.low[1]` | `CopyRates(_Symbol, _Period, 1, N, rates)` with `ArraySetAsSeries(rates,false)`; `rates[n-1]` |
| `self.volume[...]` | `rates[].tick_volume` |
| `self.bar_count` | `Bars(_Symbol, _Period)` / `iTime(_Symbol,_Period,1)` |
| — (MT-only) | `POSITION_PROFIT` + `POSITION_SWAP` + `POSITION_COMMISSION` for the Section 2.4 net-profit check |
| `MutSeriesF` state | global structs + persisted journal (per account/server/symbol, tester sandbox) |
| `isnan(x)` | `!MathIsValidNumber(x)` |
| `int(state + 0.5)` | guarded conversion with `0` fallback |
| `self.info.price_precision` | `(int)SymbolInfoInteger(_Symbol,SYMBOL_DIGITS)`, finite guard, fallback `5` |
| manual Newton root for variance | `MathSqrt(variance)` (keep `* 0.75`, clamp `>=1`, cap `max_horizon`) |
| `round(x, price_digits)` | `DoubleToString(x, digits)` / `NormalizeDouble` to tick grid |
| `color.AQUA/RED/YELLOW/GREEN/NAVY` | MT5 `clrAqua` / `clrRed` / `clrYellow` / `clrLimeGreen` / dark slate |
| `Var[Table]` dashboard | `MT_CRF_Panel.mqh` chart objects, updated on `is_last_bar` equivalent |
| `@param.*` | `input` in `MT_CRF_Inputs.mqh` |
| 6 `plot.*` returns | `MTCRF_*` chart objects |
| `self.is_last_bar` | update panel only on the latest bar / `ChartSupported()` check |

CRF is fixed to **`PERIOD_M15`** closed bars and reuses MT's existing M15 lane. `ChartSupported()` still allows the EA on M5/M15/M30, but CRF always calls `CopyRates(_Symbol, PERIOD_M15, 1, N, rates)` and `iTime(_Symbol, PERIOD_M15, 1)`. **The attached chart timeframe is not the CRF timeframe**: on an M5 or M30 chart the M15 lane still exists, so CRF still works. Attaching to an **M15 chart** is recommended for clarity only, not required. `max_horizon=24` = **6h on M15**; `history_bars=600` ≈ 6.25 days of M15 bars. No other HTF.

## 7. Proposed files and minimal edits

New files in `hamamun/MT`:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `MT_CRF.md` | this specification (placed by user) |
| `MT_CRF_Inputs.mqh` | `InpMode` enum + 9 ported `InpCrf*` inputs + `InpCrfCloseProfitableM15` (default `true`) |
| `MT_CRF_Kernels.mqh` | pure functions: patterns, ATR, context, analogs, duration, formatting; no broker calls |
| `MT_CRF_Runtime.mqh` | state structs, new-bar scan, candidate/confirmation/forecast, persistence, `CRFPlan` adapter |
| `MT_CRF_Panel.mqh` | `CRF:` 2nd-row status, `Input mode:` settings badge, M15-row CRF rendering, full 15-row dashboard in details window, `MTCRF_*` objects |
| `MT_CRF_Diary.mqh` | strategy `30007` rows / CRF-specific fields reusing `P5Begin` style |
| `tests/test_crf_kernels.py` | source-derived stub tests for patterns/context/analogs/duration |
| `tests/test_crf_runtime.py` | candidate → confirm → active → close, restart, NaN/corrupt state |
| `tests/test_crf_mode.py` | `MT only` / `MT + CRF` / `CRF only` gating, takeover, resume, `InpCrfCloseProfitableM15` on/off, net-cost buffer, waiting-for-closing, hard-expiry-before-slot-free |

Small edits to existing MT files (no behaviour change when `MT only`):

| File | Edit |
|---|---|
| `MT.mq5` | include new files; call `CRFUpdate()` after `P2Update()` in `OnTick` on a new closed bar; `CRFInit()` / `CRFClose()` in `OnInit` / `OnDeinit`; gate `P4Process()` by `InpMode`; call `CRFPanel()` from `UpdatePanel()` |
| `MT_Panel.mqh` | hooks for the `CRF:` line, `Input mode:` badge and M15-row override; existing objects untouched |
| `MT_AutoRuntime.mqh` | add `CRFPlace()` + CRF ownership view mapped to the **M15 display slot** + Section 2.4 profitable-M15 close path; do not alter `P4Decide()` for M5/M30 |
| `MT_TradeDiaryRuntime.mqh` | accept a strategy override / new `30007` row; keep `30004` / `30006` unchanged |
| `README.md` | document `Mode`, CRF source, `30007`, safety, unverified status |

---

## 8. Tests and verification

Build acceptance order:

1. All **14 existing** MT stub tests still pass unchanged.
2. New CRF stub tests pass: patterns, context, 2-bar confirmation, candidate expiry/merge, analog weights, duration hard expiry, NaN/corrupt state, three Modes, takeover/resume, no duplicate positions, `InpCrfCloseProfitableM15` on/off, net-cost buffer, waiting-for-closing, hard-expiry-before-slot-free.
3. `MT only` produces identical panel, orders, diary and tests to current MT; `InpCrfCloseProfitableM15` has no effect.
4. `InpCrfCloseProfitableM15` default is **`true`**; with `false`, an open MT M15 position is never closed by CRF.
5. `MT + CRF` default: CRF watches M15; on `Meets selected filters` the M15 slot is obtained (close profitable MT position if allowed, else wait), then one CRF order in the M15 row; only M15 MT entries pause, M5/M30 continue; after broker close + next M15 bar the M15 row resumes normal MT.
6. `CRF only`: no MT orders; M15-shaped CRF rows on the main panel + full 15-row dashboard in the details window.
7. No two TPs, no TP extension, no rewriting closed result, no `nan` text.
8. **MetaEditor compile** of `MT.mq5` + all `MT_*.mqh` (still unverified today).
9. **Strategy Tester** with real spread/commission/slippage.
10. **Demo account**, then only small live.

Remember: `100% | N samples` is historical follow-through, **not** a win rate and not a guarantee. A chart price touch is not a broker fill.

## 9. Decisions already made by this spec

- `Mode = MT + CRF (default) / MT only / CRF only`.
- `InpAutoTrading` stays the real-money master switch.
- `MT + CRF` = CRF temporarily takes over the **existing M15 lane**; M5/M30 keep running. No 4th auto row, no separate CRF strip.
- `CRF only` = CRF sole signal, plan and auto source; only the M15-shaped rows remain; full dashboard in details window; MT header/settings kept.
- CRF fixed to `PERIOD_M15` **data**, not the chart timeframe; attached chart may be M5/M15/M30, M15 recommended for clarity only; no other HTF.
- Two header additions: `CRF:` one-line status on the 2nd row beside timer (Modes with CRF), and `Input mode: xxx` on the settings first row beside `Minimum Lot` (all Modes).
- Confirmed reversal active → M15 `SG` = `BUY/SELL (CRF)`, `PT` = CRF expiry, GT/CT/ST/RG/SC = `--`; M15 plan shows CRF entry/SL/TP; M15 auto row shows the CRF broker order.
- New input `InpCrfCloseProfitableM15 = true` (**default true**): with a confirmed CRF forecast, CRF may close a net-profitable MT-native M15 position after broker checks; if not profitable enough, show `Waiting for closing`; if `false`, never close.
- Pending M15 MT limit cancelled at takeover; M5/M30 pending limits untouched; an already-open M15 MT position is handled by Section 2.4, never duplicated.
- After CRF ends, M15 returns to normal MT on the next M15 closed bar + reconciliation; CRF keeps watching until the next call.
- Market order at current Ask/Bid; CRF close kept as plan entry; slippage recorded.
- Hard expiry closes a still-open CRF position at market; no extension.
- Opposite / newer confirmed reversal starts a **fresh CRF forecast**, not a return to MT.
- Confirmed variant's retained `Last ...` idle labels are kept.
- Force broker SL ON for CRF; `InpPlaceStopLoss=false` applies only to MT-native lanes.
- New diary strategy `30007`; existing `30004` / `30006` untouched.

---

## 10. Explicitly NOT in scope

- `reversal_forecast.indie` (original) and `reversal_continuation_forecast.indie` (PR #8 third file).
- Continuation candles, continuation default-ON, aqua continuation marker, single-state blank idle panel.
- Stage 1 / Stage 2 A/B/C, one-live-row design, separate 4th indicator.
- A separate 4th CRF auto-execution row or a compact CRF strip under settings; the M15 lane is reused instead.
- A second `Minimum net profit` input; the close-cost buffer is computed internally, not user-set.
- Staged/rolling TP, TP extension, indefinite extension, updating an old TP, two TPs, rewriting a closed/missed forecast into a win.
- Extra candle-pattern families, any HTF other than the fixed M15 CRF lane, adaptive/trained expiry.
- Editing the two original `.indie` files in `hamamun/Predictor`.
- Changing MT's `30004` / `30006` diary IDs, `P4Decide()` for M5/M30, or M5/M30 3-lane behaviour. The M15 open-position close in Section 2.4 is the one approved exception.
- Live trading before MetaEditor compile, Strategy Tester and demo verification.

**Next step:** copy this file into `hamamun/MT`, then ask for the build in a session/checkout tied to that repo. No `.mq5` code, commit or PR has been created here.
